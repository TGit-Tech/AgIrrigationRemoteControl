![Hand Remote](/pics/Hand_PumpControl_Units.png)
# Overview
- A solid urban 2-Mile range; possibly more depending on location and setup
- One Hand-Remote can control multiple pumps
- Multiple Hand-Remotes can control one pump
- Simple addition of a digital pressure gauge for water pressure monitoring
- Simple addition of an Ultrasonic distance meter for water level monitoring
- Implements a stay-off after power bump that is required by power companies
- Hand-Remote has settable Alarms that signal (via buzzer) unexpected conditions such as:
    - Power not as expected ( Alarms when power is lost causing pump shutdown )
    - Water Pressure ( if equipped ) for when a hose falls off
    - Ditch Water Level ( if equipped ) too high or low

# I'll Build one for you!
I'll be building a few of these units complete with
- (1) Hand-Remote; Custom programmed to your irrigation setup
- (1) Pump-Controller; Custom programmed to your irrigation setup
- (1) Installation Kit including:
    - The required 480VAC 3-phase Power Supply
    - A 480VAC Solid State Relay for Motor Starter Control
    - 600V Hook-Up wire required to install the Motor control

I'll only sell within the U.S.
I'll be asking $379 ( Free Shipping ) for the complete kit and will be listing the first few on Amazon.
If you'd like to purchase a kit you can email me directly at tgit28@gmail.com
I may offer a small discount of the amazon sale charges and will take payment through paypal.
