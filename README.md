# AgIrrigationRemoteControl
Control an Ag Industrial 3-Phase Irrigation Pump with Arduino UNO and XBee RF

![Hand Remote](/pics/Hand_PumpControl_Units.png)
# Overview
- A solid rural 2-Mile range; possibly more ( 900MHz @ 1/4-Watt Transceiver )
- No cellular, FCC liscensing or any other charges; Just hook it up and use
- One Hand-Remote can control multiple irrigation pumps
- Multiple Hand-Remotes can control one irrigation pump
- Uses Pump Panels "AUTO" selection; doesn't disturb Manual Hand-Off & Start sequences
- Implements a "stay-off" after a power loss that is required by power companies
- Hand-Remote has settable Alarms that signal (via buzzer) unexpected conditions such as:
    - Power not as expected ( Alarms when pump shutdown has occured by a power loss )
    - Water Pressure ( if equipped ) for when a hose falls off
    - Ditch Water Level ( if equipped ) too high or low
- Simple expansion of a digital pressure gauge for water pressure monitoring
- Simple expansion of an Ultrasonic distance meter for water level monitoring

# I'll Build one for you!
I'll be building a few of these units complete with
- (1) Hand-Remote; Custom programmed to your irrigation setup
- (1) Pump-Controller; Custom programmed to your irrigation setup
- (1) Installation Kit including:
    - The required 480VAC 3-phase Power Supply
    - A 480VAC or higher Solid State Relay for Motor Starter Control
    - 600V THHN Hook-Up wire required to Motor control installation
